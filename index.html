  <h1>Peru Tips</h1>

  <h2>Traveling to Peru</h2>
  <p>
    Aeropuerto Internacional Jorge Chávez (LIM) is the main airport hub for international flights to Peru. Travel from the airport
    to the city center can be done by car only. We recommend taking one of the taxis from the taxi companies in the arrivalterminal
    (right after customs) or arranging a pickup with your hotel prior to your arrival. Expect around one hour of travel time
    by car from the airport to Miraflores or Barranco.
  </p>

  <h2>Traveling in Peru</h2>
  <p>
    With incredible biodiverse regions to choose from, the possibilities for travel in Peru are virtually endless. It’s up to
    you if you want to visit the coastal desert, discover the Andes, or the Amazon jungle (or all three!). Below is our list
    of suggested tourist destinations.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h2>Mountains</h2>
      <p>
        Peru is home to the largest portion of the Andes. Home to Cuzco, Machu Picchu, the Sacred Valley, Arequipa, and Titicaca,
        an Andean adventure is a must if you come to Peru for the first time.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Cuzco, Machu Picchu, &amp; Sacred Valley of the Inkas</h4>
          <p>
            To discover the impressive architectural feats of the Inkas, and learn about this Andean culture’s way of life immersed in
            breath-taking mountain views is no less than life-changing. Be very respectful of the altitude, and make sure
            you take it super easy the first day (by super easy I mean rest all day and drink coca leaf tea). Your body needs
            time to adjust to the altitude. If you already know you’re sensitive to high altitudes, fly to Cusco from Lima,
            and descend immediately to the sacred valley. You can take the train to Machu Picchu from there, and then do
            the city of Cuzco on the last day. If you’re seriously adventurous, you can plan very ahead of time and do the
            proper Inka trail. You can choose to do the 3 day, 5 day, or full week hike, where you’ll climb up the Machu
            Picchu mountain and arrive at the Sun Gate of Machu Picchu at sunrise. Just make sure you book ahead of time
            and be honest about your fitness level. Climbing at high altitude is no easy feat.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Puno & Lake Titicaca</h4>
          <p>
            The region of Puno is home to the highest navigable body of water in the world. Lake Titicaca is considered one of the most
            beautiful places on earth, no wonder the Inkas believed it was the birthplace of their main deity, the sun. The
            people who inhabit the lake do so on islands made of reeds since Precolombian times. Again, be respectful of
            the altitude, and take it easy your first day. You can travel from Cuzco to Tititcaca by luxury train. Alternatively,
            you can also take a bus. Expect about 1 day of travel.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Arequipa</h4>
          <p>
            Called the white city, this beautiful colonial city in the mountains is home to the Misti Volcano and the famous Colca Canyon,
            home of the Peruvian Condor. Explore old Peruvian monasteries, eat amazing food at their picanterías, hike the
            Cordillera Blanca, and enjoy the Colca from thermal baths under the stars.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>


      <h2>Jungle</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Tambopata Reserve & Manu National Park</h4>
          <p>
            Tambopata is a national reserve in the south of the Amazon basin. You can enjoy the incredible flora and fauna of the Amazon
            jungle in one of the many eco-lodges on the shores of the Madre de Dios River. Adjacent to the Tambopata reserve
            is the Manu National Reserve, known for its rich biodiversity. Home to jaguars, macaws, black caimans, and anacondas,
            it’s a must if you’re interested in jungle fauna.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Iquitos</h4>
          <p>
            Iquitos is the largest city in the world that cannot be reached by road. Called the gateway to the jungle, you can fly here
            to experience a vibrant capital before embarking on an Amazon journey.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Kuelap &amp; Gocta</h4>
          <p>
            In the southern part of the Amazonas region, you can visit the Chachapoyas fortress Kuelap and visit the incredible waterfalls
            of Gocta. Some say the beauty of Kuelap rivals that of Machu Picchu.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>

      <h2>Coast</h2>
      <p>
        The coastal desert of Peru is home to the legacies of the Pre-Columbian cultures of Paracas and Nazca. It is also home to
        beautiful and peaceful beaches in the north like Máncora.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Paracas, Nazca &amp; Huacachina</h4>
          <p>
            The bay of
            <strong>Paracas </strong>is home to a natural reserve with incredible beaches, and the opportunity to do boat tours of
            the Ballestas Islands, home to Humboldt penguins, sea lions and the mysterious candelabra in the sand.
            <strong>Huacachina </strong>is a desert oasis surrounded by beautiful sand dunes, one hour south of Paracas. It’s unbelievably
            fun to climb in one of the sand buggies and drive through the beautiful landscape of sand dunes. Surrounded by
            desert, one feels more in a Star Wars movie than in Peru.
            <strong>Nazca </strong>is home to the mystical Nazca lines. To this day, no one knows how the Nazca people managed to
            carve these kilometric lines in the sand, which remain intact to this day. To see them in full, you have to board
            an aeroplane and look at them from the air. Common folklore says that the Nazca people were aided by aliens in
            their construction of the lines, and once you see them, you’ll be tempted to share that belief.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Mancora</h4>
          <p>
            Mancora is a beautiful beach in the north of Peru. A haven for surfers and beach bums, it’s a great place to eat fresh fish,
            hang out, and and swim.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Lima</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Sleep</h3>
          <p>
            We strongly recommend booking a hotel in Miraflores or Barranco. Adjacent to each other overlooking the sea, together they
            make up the cultural hub of Lima. Most wedding festivity events will take place in Miraflores. In Barranco you
            can enjoy beautiful walks on the Malecón overlooking the ocean. The scene at night in Barranco is super lively,
            home to cozy bars and amazing restaurants.
          </p>

          <h3>Eat</h3>
          <p>
            Perhaps the most important thing you need to do in Lima is experience the city’s amazing food. Peruvian cuisine is spectacular,
            and Lima boasts some of the world’s best restaurants. From traditional Peruvian to Nikkei, these restaurants
            represent what we most miss living abroad.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>La Trattoria di Mambrino</h4>
              <p>
                Clearly biased here. Ugo and Sandra Plevisani started La Trattoria as a tiny restaurant nearly 30 years ago. Now moved to
                Larcomar, it remains a staple of incredible Italian cuisine in Lima.
                <a href="http://latrattoriadimambrino.com" target="_blank">website</a>

            <li>
              <h4>Mercado</h4>
              <p>
                Ceviche is meant to be eaten during daytime, so cevicherias are closed at night. Queue up here for chef Rafael Osterling’s
                variations of ceviche, tiradito, and grilled seafood for lunch. Worth the wait.

            <li>
              <h4>Maido</h4>
              <p>
                The best place to try Nikkei food, the incredible marriage of Peruvian and Japanese cuisines. Both traditions are an ode
                to fresh fish, and once you eat here you’ll understand why.
                <a href="http://www.maido.pe/" target="_blank">website</a>

              <p>
                Great place to enjoy Latin-American and Peruvian fusion dishes. The terrace is a lively spot to get a great Pisco Sour and
                enjoy their incredible corn-pie.

              <h4>Canta Rana</h4>
              <p>
                An institution in Barranco known for their ceviche. The wood-paneling is full of soccer paraphernalia, and may be the coziest
                spot to get lunch in Barranco. Get the ceviche mixto, the tiradito, and chicharrón de calamar.
                <a href="https://www.google.com.pe/maps/place/Canta+Rana/@-12.1468009,-77.0244545,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x9105b7ee06c6e0d7:0x5cf2be4a10553492!8m2!3d-12.1468009!4d-77.0222658"

                fancy.

              <p>
                Restaurant in Barranco famed for serving old-school hearty Peruvian classics. Definitely not light food, but totally worth
                it. If the line is long, we suggest you wait.

              <h4>La Picantería</h4>
              <p>
                Great restaurant if you love fish. You pick one from the cooler and they make three dishes of your choice out of it. Their
                fried fish ‘chicharrón’ is among the best.

              <p>
                Incredible restaurant to enjoy delicacies of Chiclayo by chef Hector Solís. Famous for their ‘grilled ceviche’! A must.

            <li>
              <h4>Chifa Titi</h4>
              <p>
                Chinese-Peruvian restaurants, called ‘Chifas’, are endemic to Perú and ubiquitous around the country. You have to know where
                to go. Chifa Titi is the absolute best! Their Peking duck is out of this world.

              <p>
                Great cafe for salads, pastas, and sandwiches. Their outpost in front of la Huaca Pucllana is our absolute favorite because
                of the beautiful terrace. Don’t forget to get dessert!

                in a salt crust.

              <h4>Chez Wong</h4>
              <p>
                This hole in the wall is an institution. Chef Javier Wong filets the fish in front of you before he cuts it up into a ceviche
                or a dish of the day. Some may say its the best ceviche in the world.

                Coffee shop with Sandra Plevisani’s amazing desserts. Stop by for breakfast (the french toast is to die for) or for afternoon
                tea and cake. Our favorites are the dark chocolate mini cheesecakes.

              <h4>Pan, Sal, Aire</h4>
              <p>
